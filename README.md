ðŸ‘‹ Vue 3 Reusable Components ðŸ‘‹
by Annette Le Sage version 1.0 (updated 2/2/24)

ðŸ‘€ This is a demo project that I have developed with Vue 3. I have been experimenting with creating reusable components to which custom data, logic and styling can be applied. All three pages, Home, Fakelandia and Mars Rover, draw from the same set of components. Although the pages have different content and styling, each uses same set of components.

âœ¨ Technologies
The project uses the JavaScript framework Vue.js and the Vite development environment. The Vue 3 Composition API has been used in this project. The Canvas.js Javascript library has been included to use to create charts, for which data is randomly generated in Vue Composables. Vue Router has been used for page routing and Pinia has been used for State Management.

ðŸ™‚ Components
The components have been designed to be reusable and the aim of the project has been to experiment with and demonstrate their flexibility.

ðŸŒ± CSS
This project demonstrates styles in CSS using BEM (Block__Element--modifier) naming conventions, which have been extended further using SASS.

ðŸ“« Usage
To use, fork the repo, run npm install and then npm run dev.
